**Estimated hours**: 4 Hours 

## Content Insights
- LinkedIn Video: Introduction to Web Design and Development <br>
This video provided sufficient information needed to recall the concepts that was previously covered in 
CP1406, while it has been a while since I wrote HTML and CSS codes, the video has helped alot in recalling some of the 
important concepts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while also introducing new information such as incorporating GitHub to 
manage files, choosing web hosting, registering a domain, and exploring the new concept of Content Management Systems.


- LinkedIn Learning: Technology for Product Managers <br>
The video was an additional resources I used to get a brief understanding about Content Management Systems. It was
one of the courses that appeared when I searched for CMS. Upon closer inspection on the content I was particularly 
drawn towards watching some of the contents particularly Web Development and how CMS played an important role of 
simplifying the process of developing and deploying a website. For instance, the video touched on the difference 
between the old days when companies hire programmers to code websites and the modern times when it only took a 
few clicks of a button to develop and deploy a website.


- YouTube: Learn Markdown in 1 minute <br>
This video showed me the quickest possible way to grasp the concept of using Markdown through demonstrating how
Markdown syntax were written correctly.



## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
- LinkedIn Video: Introduction to Web Design and Development <br>
While it was a rather extensive course to go through, I find that taking breaks in between and resuming it at a later
time helped me digest the information and prevented me from suffering information overload. Additionally, taking notes
on a notebook and summarizing the information helped in remembering the concept.


- LinkedIn Learning: Technology for Product Managers <br>
Having the knowledge of both coding a website from scratch and being proficient in using several CMS would mean 
versatility in the workplace. Having possess both valuable skills in the workplace would benefit my future employer 
from hiring another staff or outsourcing the work 
to third party.


- YouTube: Learn Bootstrap in less than 20 minutes - Responsive Website Tutorial &  Learn Markdown in 1 minute <br>
For both YouTube video tutorials, instead of just watching the video or taking notes, I attempted them just so it
enables to gain better understanding how to implement Bootstrap in my webpages and also documenting them using 
Markdown. In the end I found that doing this type of learning approach was rather engaging and interactive. 
Additionally, it saves time too.


- Guides: Get started with Bootstrap
The Bootstrap website offered extensive instructions, however focusing on the essential information such as 
Understanding the basic functionality and implementing it into my coding was sufficient to get me started in
developing my website. This approach enables to identify key ideas in a short time, which is a valuable skill in any
learning and employability endeavor. 


- Guides: GitHub Pages
From this experience, I learn that index.html files play a crucial role in hosting websites. When the file is not 
present in the main directory, then trying to access the webpage from the root URL will not automatically show the 
content. This explains why my first static website was showing error 404 upon first deployment. I realized that the
webpages files were inside the "startup" folder I initially created when starting my pract work. Copying the files
and putting them on the main repository solved the issue.
