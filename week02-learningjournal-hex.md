**Estimated hours**: 6 Hours 

## Content Insights
- LinkedIn Learning Video:  WordPress 5 Essential Training <br>
The video helped me understand the three main contents types in WordPress, namely the Post, Pages and Media Elements. 
This led to introducing the concept of creating these three elements using WordPress Block editor, particularly Block 
Creation. I learned that users can create blocks by simply typing their content (text or paragraph) onto the editor 
while hitting backspace removes content. Other than that, the video showed some basic concepts of customizing these 
block to our liking using the block toolbar. Equivalently eliminating the need to update the CSS style code when we 
try to customize our webpage HTML file.


- LinkedIn Learning: Version Control <br>
This video was used as a refresher to review the concept of Version Control, which covers the basics of tracking down 
projects through Commits made for any new changes to files or project by writing Actionable words and in short sentences
to describe the update made, Pull updates from the main repository on GitHub to local cloned repository or from other 
collaborators updates after reviewing, Push updates from local to main repository, Creating Branches to avoid making 
changes to the Main branch and lastly, understanding version control in WordPress context. I particularly thought this
would be a great content to revise on as version control is heavily used in this subject, specifically when it comes to
collaborative work.


- Guide: How to Install Linux NGINX, MySQL, PHP <br>
This guide helped me install the LEMP software stack on Ubuntu that was installed on my virtual machine hosted at 
DigitalOcean. It included a brief introduction of these stacks that included the webserver, database and PHP to handle 
dynamic processing. The main insight was being able to follow through the process of installing the web server (NGINX) 
using command lines "sudo apt update" and "sudo apt install NGINX". Following through the guide also covered how MySQL
database was installed using "sudo apt install mariadb" and lastly installing the PHP processor. One of the important
lessons from this guide was that MariaDB, a fork of MySQL, was preferred due to the source provided below. Additionally,
it is secured, so part of the installation procedures was skipped.

- Joomla Tutorial for Beginners (Step-by-Step) <br>
Comprehensive guide to setting up my Joomla Website from getting a web hosting service, to installing and setting up 
Joomla and some additional readings on Get familiar with Joomla basics and more. Further reading would be done at a 
later date as I proceed to develop my startup website using Joomla CMS.


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Learning WordPress as the main learning video while simultaneously installing a different CMS can be quite confusing,
however I came to understand that both CMS serves the same purpose. And to reflect on this week's practical, it may
seem like this activity tests my ability to transfer the skill and knowledge and apply it to a different context. For 
instance, in the context of programming and programming languages. Despite having different languages used and syntax, 
they still followed similar concept and purpose. Applying this sort of philosophy of knowledge and skill transfer may 
be beneficial when working in the IT industry as it is expected of us Graduates to be able to learn and adapt quickly 
to the rather changing work environment and advancement of technology.

Besides that, highlighting more on my previous learning journal, having a pen and paper allowed me to recall my learning 
quite effectively. That said, being able to process the information in my mind and put it on to writing helped me 
remember more rather than just watching and listening. However, I realize that this method can be time-consuming as 
I find myself repeatedly playing back the video quite frequently than what Iâ€™m supposed to. This result in delaying 
my study progress. Based from this, I need to adjust the way how I study when it comes to viewing lecture videos more 
effectively.

Other than that, in terms of version control, the learning video made me evaluate my current way of doing projects. 
In retrospective, I usually keep backup copies of my files locally with version numbers. Applying version control 
techniques eliminate the need to do so. It is also quite handy when it comes to comparing and tracking changes, 
especially for collaborative projects. Thus, being able to maintain consistency and proficient in keeping version 
control would benefit me professionally.
