# Week 1 <br/>
Weekly learning journal entry for CP3402 Week 1 by Hexon Hartley Jimenez

## Learning Activities & Resources
For this week, main highlight of my learning would be the setting up of two repositories on GitHub for hosting the 
static website and Learning Journal as per instructed in this week's practical. Both tasks were undertaken after 
completing my list of learning activities I have set for myself which includes:
- Watching the pre-recorded seminar video to get a gist of the upcoming topic to be covered and also 
 to prepare myself in advance,
- Attending the seminar and practical class sessions for the purpose of verifying my assumptions just to move from
doubt to certainty and also to seek for additional information that are not covered in the pre-recorded video.
- Utilizing the recommended learning materials such as watching the recommended LinkedIn Learning video for this week, 
and
- Following tutorials on installing the tools that are required for the subject.

Throughout these activities, I spent time familiarizing myself with Markdown syntax, which I am expected to use
extensively for this subject particularly, in documenting my learning journey and also for the GitHub platform. This
includes reading more on online guides and YouTube tutorials.

The resources I have used (excluding materials from LearnJCU) for this week includes:

## Content Insights
- LinkedIn Video: Introduction to Web Design and Development
> This video provided sufficient information needed to recall the concepts that was previously covered in
> CP1406, while it has been a while since I wrote HTML and CSS codes, the video has helped alot in recalling some of the
> important concepts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while also introducing new information such as incorporating GitHub to
> manage files, choosing web hosting, registering a domain, and exploring the new concept of Content Management Systems.

- LinkedIn Learning: Technology for Product Managers
> The video was an additional resources I used to get a brief understanding about Content Management Systems. It was
> one of the courses that appeared when I searched for CMS. Upon closer inspection on the content I was particularly 
> drawn towards watching some of the contents particularly Web Development and how CMS played an important role of 
> simplifying the process of developing and deploying a website. For instance, the video touched on the difference 
> between the old days when companies hire programmers to code websites and the modern times when it only took a 
> few clicks of a button to develop and deploy a website.

- YouTube: Learn Bootstrap in less than 20 minutes - Responsive Website Tutorial
> This YouTube video was useful in teaching me more about how to get started with Bootstrap 5 which is a popular CSS 
> framework for building responsive websites. It covers crucial topics related to the basics of Bootstrap, how it is
> implemented into any HTML project, their grid systems, containers and other components. 

- YouTube: Learn Markdown in 1 minute
> This video showed me the quickest possible way to grasp the concept of using Markdown through demonstrating how
> Markdown syntax were written correctly.

- Article: Markdown
> This resource provides comprehensive information on Markdown. It explained the basics of Markdown syntax, their 
> benefits for various purposes such as being portable where files with Markdown-formatted text can be opened using 
> any applications, being used in everything to create websites, documents email messages and documentation, 
> particularly version controls and writing README.md files documentation that will be used quite often in this subject. 

- Guides: Get started with Bootstrap
> I used this resource just to get an idea what "Bootstrap" is as this word is unfamiliar to me. Having to read more
> about Bootstrap made me realize that this tool is quite useful in developing and designing website
> fast. From reading through the site content, I learn that this tool offer a lot of features and options to help in 
> customizing how my website look and feel through the use of templates and readily available source code to experiment
> on. Making it easier to incorporate into my website or at least a portion of it.

- Guides: GitHub Pages
> A simple website that introduces an alternative way to host my static website for free. It shows the step by step 
> process of creating a repository, using the alternative git clients (with separate instructions), cloning the 
> repository to my local machine, adding the website files, committing and finally pushing changes to the main 
> repository.
> 
> Based from this guide, I managed to host my static site according to the task instruction. In the process, 
> I encountered an issue where my website was showing 404 error. This was resolved when I moved the index.html and
> the other website files (HTML files, CSS and Images folder) out from the "startup" folder that was initially added,
> into my local machine and pushed the update to the main repository.


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
- LinkedIn Video: Introduction to Web Design and Development
> While it was a rather extensive course to go watch, I find that taking breaks in between and resuming it at a later
> time helped me digest the information and prevented me from suffering information overload. Additionally, taking notes
> on a notebook and summarizing the information helped in remembering the concept.

- LinkedIn Learning: Technology for Product Managers
> Although this was not part of the recommended learning material, I chose to have a look out of curiosity.
> As a Career/Employability insight from watching this video, having the knowledge of both coding a website from 
> scratch and being proficient in using several CMS would mean versatility in the workplace. Having possess both 
> valuable skills in the workplace would benefit my future employer from hiring another staff or outsourcing the work 
> to third party.

- YouTube: Learn Bootstrap in less than 20 minutes - Responsive Website Tutorial &  Learn Markdown in 1 minute
> For both YouTube video tutorials, instead of just watching the video or taking notes, I attempted them just so it

> Markdown. In the end I found that doing this type of learning approach was rather engaging and interactive. 
> Additionally, it saves time too.

- Article: Markdown
> Understanding Markdown and using version control on platform such as GitHub are valuable skills to possess. 
> Having such skills enable me to collaborate well in teams and project management. Learning Markdowns highlights 
> the importance of effective communication and practicing documentation standards that are widely used in the industry. 

- Guides: Get started with Bootstrap
> The Bootstrap website offered extensive instructions, however focusing on the essential information such as 
> understanding the basic functionality and implementing it into my coding was sufficient to get me started in
> developing my website. This approach enables to identify key ideas in a short time, which is a valuable skill in any
> learning and employability endeavor. 

- Guides: GitHub Pages
> From this experience, I learn that index.html files play a crucial role in hosting websites. When the file is not 
> present in the main directory, then trying to access the webpage from the root URL will not automatically show the 
> content.
