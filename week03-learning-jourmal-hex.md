* Group Interview: <br> 
At the beginning of the session, we find it hard to decide on the process of conducting the interview.
So the group proposed a pseudo-algorithm to go through the interview, that includes diving ourselves into Group A and B
consisting of 5 members, each has to Interview the other team member for 2 minutes and switch to another member of the

to fit into the time frame. As I progress further in the Interview session, I finally had a set of important questions to
ask which includes knowing their preferred roles, availability, strengths and witnesses. In the second process, I already
formulated a set of short and simple questions to ask my peers while similarly trying to get insights of what my they ask.

these questions becomes shorter and simple, as a result, I learn to prioritize what question is important to gain an
insight of a potential team member of my group and lastly, different sets of questions changes in order to fit the limited
time available. To reflect on this experience, I
