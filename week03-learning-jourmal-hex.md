   - Installing the web server (NGINX) using command lines "sudo apt update" and "sudo apt install NGINX".
   - MySQL database was installed using "sudo apt install mariadb"

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Group Interview: At the beginning of the session, we find it hard to decide on the process of conducting the interview.

This way I could weigh in the difference between my selection criteria and theirs. At the end of the session, I learned
that not all questions are necessary to be asked when it does not fit a particular time frame. Given the iteration process,
these questions becomes shorter and simple, as a result, I learn to prioritize what question is important to gain an
insight of a potential team member of my group and lastly, different sets of questions changes in order to fit the limited
time available. To reflect on this experience, I
