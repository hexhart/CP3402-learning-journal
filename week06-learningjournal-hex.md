* LinkedIn Video: Having Daily Stand-up Meetings
  - Meetings to be held daily but not necessarily first thing in the morning, maybe around 9.30am
  - Team stands and face each other to keep the meeting short,
  - Each team has its own standup, merging with different team is not encouraged,
  - Meeting should optimally be around 15 minutes, and end on time,
  - Ask 3 important questions: What did I do yesterday? What am I doing today? Are there any obstacles?
  - Developer should speak briefly, focusing on specific tasks,
  - Meeting facilitated by a Scrum master and project manager but must not dominate,
    - should reflect team's ability to self-organize.
  - Scrum master should observe team dynamics and encourage members to interact,
  - Non-developers only observe, not participate.
  - Project managers should not take over standup meetings,
    - works with Scrum master to ensure they don't undermine self-organization.
  - Scrum master's role is to emphasize on fostering a collaborative environment where teams can self-manage effectively.



## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

### 1. Client Meeting <br>
  - Having to attend the session online tested my ability to manage my time efficiently, prioritise important tasks, and adapt to sudden change in my routine:
    - Travelling from work to home instead of going to university allowed more time to rest,
    - Making use of the limited free time allowed myself to be well-rested and be mentally prepare to absorb new details during the client meeting session,
    - Changing my usual weekly routine from travelling from work to class and then going home to observe if there is a difference in my productivity,
  - 

### 2. Using and Exploring Trello<br>
  - Trello helped alot in managing the team task by visualizing it and organizing it into boards, lists, and cards that can be moved around.
  - This exercise enabled me to break down the project into smaller manageable task,
  - It demonstrated team collaboration by allowing members to share boards, assign tasks, and track our team progress collectively.
  - Learning how to use Trello demonstrated and enhanced teamwork, communication, and coordination.
  - The visual representation of the tasks worked as a visual aid in showing the project progress,
    - Allowing my team to share ideas, feedbacks, and shared understanding.


### 3. Integrate GitHub repo and Trello board<br>
  - Before integrating GitHub with Trello, I found myself constantly:
    - switching between tabs, 
    - trying to keep track of what needed to be done,
    - what code changes were made, 
    - and who was responsible for each task. 
  It was a chaotic mess that often led to missed deadlines and confusion within my project teams. 
    - Integrating GitHub repositories with Trello boards, I've learned the immense value of consolidating project resources and workflows. 
    - Now, everything I need is neatly organized within a single platform. 
    - I can see the status of code commits, review pull requests, and assign tasksâ€”all within the context of our project boards on Trello.
This integration has not only streamlined my workflow but has also fostered greater efficiency and collaboration among my team members. No longer are we lost in a sea of emails and scattered documents; instead, we're all on the same page, working towards our common goals with clarity and purpose.
