* LinkedIn Video: Having Daily Stand-up Meetings
  - Meetings to be held daily but not necessarily first thing in the morning, maybe around 9.30am
  - Team stands and face each other to keep the meeting short,
  - Each team has its own standup, merging with different team is not encouraged,
  - Meeting should optimally be around 15 minutes, and end on time,
  - Ask 3 important questions: What did I do yesterday? What am I doing today? Are there any obstacles?
  - Developer should speak briefly, focusing on specific tasks,
  - Meeting facilitated by a Scrum master and project manager but must not dominate,
    - should reflect team's ability to self-organize.
  - Scrum master should observe team dynamics and encourage members to interact,
  - Non-developers only observe, not participate.
  - Project managers should not take over standup meetings,
    - works with Scrum master to ensure they don't undermine self-organization.
  - Scrum master's role is to emphasize on fostering a collaborative environment where teams can self-manage effectively.
