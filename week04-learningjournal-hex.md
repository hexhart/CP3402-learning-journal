## Content Insights
* LinkedIn Video: A guide to the web design proces, Version Control for Everyone, Write and commit in small chunks
   - Version Control is important to manage and tracks changes made to project files that makeup the WordPress theme (for this video),
   - VC demonstrates the importance of managing large projects by keeping a record of commits made,
   - Bug tracking is easily detectable with version control,
   - Creation of branch version enables working different version of the file in the Main repository,
   - WordPress uses Subversion, a centralized remote system/server that contains the repository. 
   - Other copies are working copies that doesn't actually contain the full history. 
   - For files to contain history connecting to the server is required using Git and Git SVN command. 
   - When making commits, focus on making small commits at a time,
   - Documentation files are written in Markdown, an industry format used across platforms like GitHub,
   - Undo options are available within the editor,
   - Version control helps to revert back any changes made after closing files,
   - While editor has undo functions, it is limited to what it can do to file once it is closed and reopened.
   - Always remember to adopt systematic versioning practices when working of any software development workflows.


* Practical Reading Material 1: Ultimate WordPress Development Workflow by Zach Adams
   -  Establishing a WordPress development workflow makes it more efficient by allowing testing, deployment and collaboration,
   - Tools to explore: Git, Vagrant, Composer, WP-CLI, Grunt (not necessary all for now)
   - Git allows for version control, making it easier to track changes and collaborate with others,
   - Vagrant helps create a reproducible and portable work environment, which is important for testing and deployment my WordPress site,
   - Adopt best practices approach in WordPress development to include coding standards, backing up data and optimizing performance,
   - Using child theme allows me to modify my WordPress theme without affecting the original, this makes it easier to update and maintain,
   - Regular backups as a safety measure to protect my work from unexpected losses, Version control works too to track down changes and revert from unwanted updates,


* Practical Reading Material 2: Getting started with Vagrant & VVV for local development
  - Vagrant runs on top of a virtual machine provider (VirtualBox), enables running codes while keeping the WordPress workflow locally,
  - It is configured within the Vagrantfile,
  - VVV is a Vagrant setup that allows WordPress development in a local machine.
  - Setup instructions found via: [1](https://github.com/varying-vagrant-vagrants/vvv) and [2](https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/docs/en-US/installation/)


* Practical Reading Material 3: Vagrant: Install Vagrant
   - Note: To install Vagrant software on local machine
   - First step is to signed up for an account using GitHub account credentials, completing this step by agreeing to the Service Agreement and clicking on "Continue"
   - On the [HashiCorp](https://developer.hashicorp.com/) homepage, click on the Vagrant shortcut button to go back to Vagrant webpage.
   - Click on Tutorials link, and select Get Started link to start setting up Vagrant.
   - Begin setting up Vagrant by downloading the installer from [Vagrant](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/install), select the appropriate installer suitable for my local machine
   - Run installer, follow through the series of steps and click "Finish" button to complete installation and Select 'No' to restart the laptop later.


* Practical Reading Material 4: Introduction to VVV ([Varying Vagrant Vagrants](https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/docs/en-US/adding-a-new-site/)): Installation, Basic Usage, Default Sites in VVV 
   - With Vagrant and Virtual Box installed, setting up VVV needs cloning the VVV repo, moving to the cloned local directory and installing the vagrant plugin,
   - Cloning the VVV repository using the code "git clone -b stable https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV.git %systemdrive%%homepath%/Desktop/bb-wordpress-projects/vvv-local",
   - Move into the cloned local directory using "cd %systemdrive%%homepath%/Desktop/bb-wordpress-projects/vvv-local"
   - The CLI command %systemdrive% represents the drive where the system is installed,
   - %homepath% represents the path to current user's home directory,
   - vvv-local is the directory path or folder name for the local environment,
   - "vagrant up" starts and provisions the virtual machine according to the Vagrant file specification.
   - "vagrant halt" shuts down the virtual machine of the local environment,
   - "vagrant reload" restarts the virtual machine.
   - To test domain for local web development environment, the link is [http://vvv.test](http://vvv.test)
   - Accessing the default local hosted site through: [http://one.wordpress.test](http://one.wordpress.test)
   - Editing the local site, the link would be: [http://one.wordpress.test/wp-admin/](http://one.wordpress.test/wp-admin/)
   - Customise the local test site by accessing www/wordpress-one/public_html/wp-content folder
   - VVVâ€™s config, database, log and www directories are shared with the virtualized server.
