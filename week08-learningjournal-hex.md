# Week 8 Learning Journal <br/>

## Learning Experiment:
* Changing the process in which group communication and collaboration are undertaken using:
  * A more electronic approach instead of traditional pen and paper methods,
    * Utilizing Trello for project management,
    * Using Figma for designing website prototypes for the group assignment.
  * Stand-Up meetings to enable open discussion with team members,

## Estimated Hours
**Estimated hours**: 2 Hours

## Learning Experiment Hypothesis: 
- Hypothesis 1:
  - Transitioning from a traditional methods to electronic approaches through the use of software tools to:
    - manage the project that includes allocation of tasks, to-do list creations, and tracking progress,
    - Electronically design prototypes and wireframe designs for websites,
  - Implementing such changes significantly improves my efficiency and organization in group work setting and dynamics,
  - Assuming Trello enables enhancement in team collaboration and streamline project management processes.
  
- Hypothesis 2:
  - Instead of lengthy discord voice chat meetings, we implement stand-up meetings physically to gain more out of our project time efficiency and productivity.
  
  
## Experiment Results: 
### 1. Using Trello to manage the project: 
  - The experiment demonstrated efficiency and organization within the group work settings by:
    - Enabling simultaneous creation of tasks, member assignment, to-do list creation, in one place,
    - Combination of Trello and conducting Stand-Up meeting allowed clarity on responsibilities and task deadlines,
    - Management of workflow was streamlined because tasks are visualized on the Trello board,
    - Changes made on our Trello are automatically notified to our discord group's #git-changes which reduced the need to conduct status update meetings,
  - In contrast to traditional methods, using post-it notes or paper can:
    - Waste a lot of paper,
    - Easily misplace notes,
    - Organizing notes can be time-consuming,
    - Unable to update users frequently,
    - Requires frequent status updates meetings,
  - However, the only advantage of using the traditional method is that there is a physical backup in the form of paper written notes made available offline incase technical issues arise.
 
### 2. Prototype and Wireframe Design with Figma:
  - Designing the website layout and prototype allows faster creation of designs,
  - Easy to access anywhere anytime providing members are granted access permissions,
  - Changes to the design are made easier than traditional methods,
    - reduce paper wastage.
  - Team collaboration is allowed where concurrent members are able to work on the same prototype design simultaneously,

### 3. Stand-Up meeting:
  - The team members does not necessary stand up during the session,
    - we conducted the meeting sitting down but facing each other in circles
    - each member take turns to answer three questions,
    - each team members progress are documented in Trello,
  - Team roadblocks are addressed and actioned to ensure team member is able to progress through their required task.
  - It is essential to limit the meeting to 15 minutes and focus on key issues to avoid wasting time.
  - Resume work after completing the meeting to avoid delay.
    

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

### Standup Meetings Learning Insight<br>
  - While stand-up meetings are essential and are intended to be short and focused, it is important to stick to a particular timeframe to ensure efficient use of the meeting time,
  - Encouragement are necessary for members to participate and contribute,
  - Adopting to the three-question format to ensure the meeting is focused, 
    - 1. What was accomplished?
    - 2. What is next?
    - 3. Are there roadblocks?
  - Identifying roadblocks among members allow us to address and resolve their issues immediately,
    - This encourages them to be more transparent with their progress status and any issues they face,
  - Being familiarized with stand-up meetings allows for: 
    - Improved accountability by following through assigned tasks and deadlines,
    - Better time management by keeping to the required meeting time addressing key issues and getting back to work without delays,
    - Increase transparency that builds trust among members and improved team dyanmic,
    - Being adaptable and agile by quickly responding to changes and adjust accordingly,
  - Conducting this meeting helps in:
    - keeping track of each member's progress and their contribution to the project,
    - being able to know if members needed assistance to progress through a task and learn from sharing experience and knowledge,
    - It eliminates the need to conduct weekly meeting,
  - However,
    - Since the meeting is conducted on the spot, some members are not willing to share full insights of their progress,
    - It requires time in getting to know newly added member and develop a rapport as compared to peers whom I have worked with in past projects,
    - Sometimes the meeting can be counterproductive if the discussion is often being interrupted especially when one member is providing their progress update,
