* LinkedIn Video: [WordPress: Workflows](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/wordpress-workflows-2/our-workflows?autoSkip=true&resume=false&u=2223545)
   - I chose to watch "Building Your First WordPress Site" as this is specific to the task this week. 
   - It is particularly important to setup a Domain or URL for a website so it is easy to remember as opposed to using IP addresses,
   - No matter what hosting service is used, it is important to have a Domain name.
   - Recommended site to get a domain: [Hover](https://www.hover.com/)
   - Hosting a website requires a server, in this case virtual machines that are provisioned by a third party web hosting company (CloudAccess, DigitalOcean, etc),
   - Server can either be configured through CLI or just a few clicks, to simplify process I chose the latter.

* Group Interview: <br>
- Prioritization:
  - I learned the importance of prioritizing questions based on their relevance while going through the interview process.
  - The limited time available made me realize that not all questions need to be asked if they don't fit within the time frame.
  - Prioritization is useful as knowing what needs to be done first is really helpful for me. It's important in the workplace because 
  the tasks we have can change a lot. If we don't prioritize well, we might not finish things on time.

- Iteration Leads to Improvement: The iterative nature of the interview process allowed me to refine and improve my approach. With each iteration, I fine-tuned my questions to be shorter and more focused, enabling me to gather essential information efficiently.

- Understanding Selection Criteria: It became clear that understanding the selection criteria for team members is crucial. This includes identifying preferred roles, availability, strengths, and weaknesses. Having clarity on these aspects helped streamline the interview process.
  - Comparing Selection Criteria: By formulating my own set of questions and observing what my peers asked, I gained insights into the different selection criteria used within the group. This comparison allowed me to evaluate the differences and similarities in our approaches.
  - Flexibility in Questioning: Learning to adapt questions to fit the time constraints was a valuable skill acquired during the interview sessions. Short and simple questions proved to be more effective in gaining insights into potential team members.
  - Importance of Active Listening: Throughout the interviews, I realized the significance of active listening. Paying attention to responses allowed me to better understand each candidate and make informed decisions.
  - Effective Communication: Clear communication within the group was essential for coordinating the interview process smoothly. Ensuring everyone understood their roles and the interview structure helped maintain efficiency.
  - Acceptance of Awkwardness: Initially, awkwardness in conversations was inevitable. However, acknowledging and accepting it as a natural part of the process helped ease tensions and fostered a more comfortable environment for discussion.
  - Reflection and Adaptation: Reflecting on each interview session allowed me to identify areas for improvement and adapt my approach accordingly. Being open to feedback and making necessary adjustments contributed to the overall effectiveness of the process.
  - Team Dynamics Matter: Lastly, the experience highlighted the importance of considering team dynamics when selecting members. Beyond individual skills and qualifications, compatibility within the group plays a significant role in achieving collaborative success.
