## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

### 1. Preparation is key <br>
  - This activity (presentation rehearsal) made me realize the importance of preparing for success in any future endeavors,
  - Being prepared allows to see mistakes and room for improvement particularly unforeseen technical issues that may arise during presentation, this includes:
    - Browser unresponsive or loading website was slow,
    - Freezing computer that requires unexpected emergency system reboot,
    - Server crashing and unable to show the updates made when pushing updates from local to staging,
  - I find it particularly satisfying when the presentation went smoothly without technical hiccups when all machines from each team were performing well,


### 2. Practice makes perfect <br>
  - The mistakes made and captured in our rehearsal records helped us see our mistakes and make major improvements,
    - We had to make several versions of our individual notes and tried presenting our content within the required time limit,
    - The challenge of making a perfect presentation is that, there will be unexpected mistakes that may occur,
      - Particularly when a team member are caught off guard to present their content,
      - This was addressed by creating a transition line to utter before moving to the next presentation.
    - This has boosted our team's confident when we presented the actual presentation.

### 3. Gaps identification <br>
  -  Rehearsing with an unfinished plan was initially daunting, but it turned out to be a blessing in disguise. 
    - It forced me to confront areas where I needed to improve, especially my pronounciation and talking clearly,
    - This pushed me out of my comfort zone. 
  - Through this process, I've noticed significant growth in my ability to adapt and refine my ideas on the fly.

### 4. Accepting feedback and improvement <br>
  - I found the feedback sessions after our trial presentation to be incredibly beneficial. 
  - Hearing insights from my teammates helped me gain a fresh perspective on our presentation, and identify areas where I could contribute more effectively.
  - The collaboration and open communication made me feel empowered and this led to improvements in our presentation.

### 5. Overcoming challenges <br>
  - We faced the challenge of:
    - Reducing our demonstration and presentation speech without affecting the content, and
    - Limiting our content for each team member to present within exactly 10 minutes ,
    - Aiming to ensure our demonstration was both realistic and impactful.
  - This experience allowed my team and I to learn how to manage our time and persevere.  
    - We were able to fine-tune our demonstration to effectively showcase the key features of our project.
    - Tried reducing our content as close to the required time limit,
    - Ensured each team member has equal and impactful parts to present.
  - This experience taught me and my team the importance of patience, staying calm under pressure, and resilience in the face of adversity.
    - In the end, we managed to record our presentation within the time limit with no mistakes, and also covering the presentation rubric.
